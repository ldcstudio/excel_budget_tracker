# Excel Budget Tracker

A lot of people can tell you how much they earn, but not how much they spend. As society continues to move away from cash, tracking expenses is getting more and more challenging. 

Not only is this due to the sheer number of transactions, but also the number of individual bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and of course subscriptions... This prompts the question:

*How much money am I really spending?*

# Overview

The VBA Budget Tracker is a tool that helps track monthly income vs expenses. Each step of the workflow is uniquely tailored, meaning that you always have complete control over how your income, expenses, and savings goals are defined and tracked. Reports are generated to help evaluate spending habits and better visualize how you are really spending your money. This tool is for anyone who wants to be in control of their personal finances.

## Community Project

This is a community project. All suggestions, feedback, and experience is encouraged! This ranges from adding recommended financial tracking metrics, to Visual Basic (VBA) code improvements for macros. To submit feedback... TBD.

## Tips

This project consists of two Excel Workbooks. Both Workbooks are identical except that one includes the VBA macros and the other does not. This gives the user a choice:

1.  Review the macros prior to use (RECOMMENDED)
    
2.  Download the existing macro enabled workbook.
    
If you choose option 1, click here TBD for details on each macro and how they can be embedded into the Project. Additional guidance is provided in column A of each sheet, just select the cell "A1" to learn more.

**DISCLAIMER:** *Macros can contain malicious code. Never run or download VBA macros from an untrusted source.*

# Workflows

After downloading the project and reviewing the individual macros, populate the following sheets:

1.  Income - List each income stream
    
2.  Expenses - List all recurring expenses
    
3.  Savings - List all savings goals
    
**NOTE:** Manipulating data across these sheets can cause issues with the formatting of the "Reports" page. If this occurs, follow the steps detailed here TBD

## Import Monthly Transactions

Once personal finance information has been completed. Navigate to the "Template" sheet and import all monthly transaction data using Macros [M] as required:

1.  [M] Clear - Remove existing table contents
    
2.  [M] Import - Select spreadsheet (.csv) to be imported
    
3.  Repeat step 2 for each bank statement, until all monthly transactions are displayed in the Transactions table

##  Create Categorization Rules

Categorization rules are a quick way of categorizing expenses. The key is to create rules for any expense that is repeated each month.

### Example #1: Subscriptions

**Description:** "Spotify..."

**Expense Category:** "Spotify"

### Example #2: Living Expenses

**Description:** "Tesco..." Or "Waitrose..."

**Expense Category:** "Groceries"

The more rules you create means the less expenses that need to be manually categorized later.

## Categorize Monthly Transactions

Once categorization rules have been created. The Macro "Categorize" can be run on the transaction data. This can be repeated as many times as needed in order to help refine the categorization rules.

##  Generate Monthly Report

Finally, once all expenses have been categorized, a monthly report can be generated by selecting the Macro "Generate". It's important to note that any existing data for the month selected will be overwritten. Report data will then be updated on the Annual "Reports" sheet.
